- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gokul-hub-dev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing the frimware for microcontrollers and microprocessor.
- Right now jumped into linux platform
- My journey in embedded system 
  -> basics in microcontroller(architure and low level firmware)
  -> microprocessor with RTOS concepts
  -> FPGA programming (Verilog , it's really amazing one, because it's clear my entire doubts related to clock,timer,cpu,....etc)
  -> Now start linux
